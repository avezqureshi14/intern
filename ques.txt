What is data cleaning:

Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. It involves tasks such as handling missing values, handling outliers, correcting typos, standardizing formats, and resolving inconsistencies.
Use of data cleaning:

Data cleaning ensures the quality and reliability of data for analysis and decision-making. It improves the accuracy of models, reduces bias, and prevents misleading insights that can arise from erroneous or incomplete data.
Function used for data cleaning:

Various functions and techniques can be used for data cleaning, depending on the specific requirements and the programming language or tool being used. Common functions include handling missing values (e.g., fillna()), removing duplicates (e.g., drop_duplicates()), and transforming data (e.g., replace()).
Explain data integration:

Data integration refers to the process of combining data from different sources or databases into a unified view or dataset. It involves resolving schema differences, resolving data conflicts, and ensuring consistency and compatibility between the integrated datasets.
Difference between data integration and merging of data:

Data integration involves combining data from different sources or databases into a unified view. It focuses on resolving schema differences and ensuring compatibility. On the other hand, merging of data typically refers to combining datasets based on a common key or attribute to create a single dataset.
Use of data transformation:

Data transformation involves converting and reshaping data to make it suitable for analysis or modeling. It can include tasks such as scaling, normalization, encoding categorical variables, feature engineering, and creating derived variables. Data transformation helps improve data quality and enables better analysis and modeling.
What is error correction:

Error correction refers to the process of identifying and rectifying errors in data. It involves identifying and fixing data inconsistencies, outliers, missing values, and other discrepancies to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
Explain Data modeling:

Data modeling is the process of creating a conceptual representation of how data is organized and related within a system or database. It involves identifying entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints. Data modeling helps in understanding data requirements, designing databases, and building data-driven applications.

It seems like you mentioned "Scrapper" in your question. If you are referring to web scraping, it is a technique used to extract data from websites. Web scraping involves writing code or using tools to scrape and collect data from web pages.

On the other hand, "Tableau" is a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool. It allows users to connect to various data sources, create interactive visualizations, and share insights with others. Tableau supports a wide range of data visualization techniques, including charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards.

Both web scraping and Tableau can be used together to gather data from web sources using web scraping techniques and then visualize and analyze that data using Tableau's data visualization capabilities. Web scraping can be used to collect data from websites and store it in a structured format, which can then be imported into Tableau for analysis and visualization. This combination can be useful for obtaining real-time or dynamic data from the web and visualizing it in Tableau for better decision-making and insights.
